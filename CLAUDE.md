# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized Airflow template repository that currently contains:
- An empty README.md file
- Basic git repository structure
- Claude Code settings configuration

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with no commits yet and minimal file structure. This appears to be a template or starting point for Apache Airflow projects.

## Configuration

- Claude Code permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` with specific bash command allowances
- The repository uses git for version control but has no commit history yet

## Development Setup

Since this is a new Airflow template, typical development commands would need to be established as the project grows. Common Airflow project patterns include:
- Virtual environment setup
- Airflow installation and configuration
- DAG development and testing
- Local Airflow instance management

## Notes

This template repository will likely be expanded with Airflow-specific structure including:
- DAGs directory for workflow definitions
- Plugins directory for custom operators
- Configuration files for Airflow setup
- Requirements files for Python dependencies
- Docker configuration for containerized deployment
